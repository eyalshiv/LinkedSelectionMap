How to use this example package:

The matlab script \LinkedSelectionMap\example\matlab\runLS_runInfrerence_example.m exemplifies the full usage of the inference scheme, applied to input data from Drosophila melanogaster's 2L chromosome.
The script calls all the interface methods:
- Initializing the configuration file
- Calculating the maps of the effects of background selection (BS) and classic sweeps (CS) for a grid of fitness effects
- Running the inference for a combined model of BS and CS
- Outputting the inferred parameters and linked selection maps to files 

Note that local directories in the file runLS_filenames_example.m and in the head of runLS_runInfrerence_example.m should be modified to the relevant directory structure.
